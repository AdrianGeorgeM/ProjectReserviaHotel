## Project Overview

The Reservia Responsive Vacation Planning Tool aims to create a user-friendly platform for finding accommodation and activities in a chosen town. The website will allow users to search for accommodation based on various filters such as budget or atmosphere. Additionally, it will provide clickable maps for both accommodation and activities.

The project follows the principles of Material Design and includes mockups for desktop and mobile versions. The prototype will be developed using HTML and CSS, ensuring a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes. The website will be compatible with the latest versions of Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.

## Functional Specifications

- Users can search for accommodation in their chosen town through an editable search field. The search input should be part of a form and be validated using W3C standards.
- All maps for accommodation and activities should be clickable, not just the titles. For now, the links can be simulated using the "href='#'" attribute.
- The filters should have a visual change during mouseover, although functionality is not required at this stage.
- The header elements "Accommodation" and "Activities" should be clickable links that lead to their respective sections.

## Technical Specifications

- The prototype will be developed using HTML and CSS, following the design mockups provided. The website will be responsive and adapt to different devices, including desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- Breakpoints for responsive design will be set at 992px and 768px, targeting computer screens and tablets, respectively. Any screen sizes below 768px will be considered for mobile phones.
- Images provided in various formats and sizes should be appropriately chosen based on resolution and loading time considerations.
- Font Awesome icons will be used, and a CDN can be employed to optimize their loading.
- The color scheme will consist of blue (#0065FC), a lighter blue variant (#DEEBFF), and a gray background (#F2F2F2).
- The Raleway font will be used for the website, and it can be imported using Google Fonts.
- The use of pixels and percentages is preferred over REMs and EMs.
- Flexbox will be used as the primary layout library, and CSS Grid will not be utilized.
- Avoid the use of CSS frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap or TailwindCSS) or pre-processors (e.g., Sass or Less).
- Semantic HTML tags such as "main," "header," "nav," etc., should be used for improved accessibility and structure.
- Validate the HTML and CSS code according to W3C standards.
- Test the prototype on the latest versions of Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.
